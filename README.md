# Movie-Land
A movie search React application

Movie Land is a simple movie search application built by React , a component-based JavaScript Library.
This is just a front-end application, so to load the movies data displayed in the app we used an external Api.
To use this Api, you need first to go to this link (omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) and create a free account. You'll receive a verification email in which you can find the code you'll use for getting data from the Api.
